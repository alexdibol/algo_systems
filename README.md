# Algo Systems  
## Institutional Formation in Systematic Trading  

Algo Systems is a governance-first institutional formation track in **systematic trading**.

Algorithmic trading is a subset of systematic trading.  
Algo Systems operates at the broader structural level — integrating engineering discipline, governed experimentation, and market mechanism literacy into a coherent institutional standard.

## Overview

Systematic trading is the disciplined modeling of markets — not the extraction of signals.

Markets are dynamic systems governed by regime shifts, liquidity topology, volatility states, funding constraints, and instrument mechanics. Performance is not the starting point of analysis. It is the consequence of correctly modeled structural conditions.

Algo Systems formalizes this premise through cumulative, deterministic, and reviewable experimentation.

This repository hosts the public-facing materials and landing page assets for the Algo Systems framework.

## Architectural Framework

The formation is structured across three integrated pillars:

### 1. Systems Discipline  
Deterministic infrastructure, execution modeling, configuration control, and governance artifacts.  
Reproducibility precedes interpretation.

### 2. Governed Strategy Laboratories  
Synthetic-first experimentation under regime variation and structural stress.  
Causal probing replaces uncontrolled optimization.

### 3. Market Mechanisms & Implementation  
Futures carry, term structures, derivatives convexity, liquidity topology, and microstructure constraints.  
Markets are treated as transactional systems, not merely price series.

Together, these pillars cultivate structural competence in systematic trading.

## Governance Model

Governance in Algo Systems is epistemic discipline.

Each laboratory:

- Produces deterministic artifacts  
- Separates assumptions from observations  
- Records configuration fingerprints  
- Applies stage gates prior to interpretation  

This ensures that conclusions are:

- Reviewable  
- Traceable  
- Structurally defensible  

The objective is not performance marketing.  
The objective is disciplined systematic reasoning.
